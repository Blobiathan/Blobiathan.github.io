## Introduction
* This datasheet shows a detailed look at my specific role in this project, and gives a better explanation of how my board connects and communicates with the rest of the group.

### Project Summary

* The projects goal is to create a remote controlled aquatic device, that can be steered and gather a variety of sense data that is reported back to the controller wirelessly. My goal in the project is to create a board that can take image data and save it to an SD card for later retreival.
* The team report can be found here [team report](https://egr314-s-2026-201.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* My board will have a camera that will collect images when promped by a button on the controller, it will save these images to a micro SD card. It will recive signals from a controller prompting it to take and save an image. This board will have an upstream and a downstream header to connect with other teammates boards.

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
