## Introduction

* This datasheet exists to explain this specific subsection of the project, specifically my board handles the measurement of sunlight and moisture for the plant monitoring system.

### Project Summary

* Our team project is a device to monitor and automatically water indoor plants. The goal of this device is to ellimate a repetive task by allowing a user to simply fill a tank with water and let the system handle the rest. My portion covers the measurements of sunlight and moisture via a photoresistor and moisture sensor respectivly.

### My Contribution

My PCB uses a moisture sensor and sunlight sensor to collect data on the plant it is monitoring. Those values are then converted into a single 0-100% value, and sent back to the main PCB via the 8 pin connection that all of our boards have. This is used to automate watering as well as inform the user of how much sunlight the plant is reciving throughout the day.
* This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction
* Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest. Information like:
