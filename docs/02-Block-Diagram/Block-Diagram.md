## Overview
Below is the block diagram for my section of team 201's device. It contains a microcontroller, camera, sd card module, and LED's for indication. The board recieves power through either a connector to the other teammembers boards, or a barrel jack, this power is regulated to 3.3V by the switching power supply. Information and power is transmitted between boards in a daisy chain format, the connector has wires for both UART communication and unregulated power.

Arrows indicate direction of the signals, and nearby text indicates the type of signal. Dashed lines indicate power, and solid lines indicate the PCB footprint.

The block diagram is useful for planning the functions of the PCB in a more abstract way before begining the design of the PCB itself.
