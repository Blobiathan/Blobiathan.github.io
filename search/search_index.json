Although this is the most expensive of the three options, it should be the most straightforward to use. The Arducam 2MP board has several components to make control and data exchange quicker, and more simple than the alternatives. Despite the steep cost I believe that it is worth it for the simplicity and higher image quality.</p> <p>MicroSD card holder:</p> <p>There are not several different types of surface mount microSD slots that can be compared, they all do exactly the same thing. The only differences between these devices is style, and maybe slight differences in quality. Because of this I found it was not helpful, or possible to create a comparison between 3 different options in regards to this device.</p> <p>Product Name: MSD-4-A Price: $0.36/each Link: Link to product</p> <p>Voltage regulator</p> <ol> <li> <p>IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2A TSOT23-6</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.71/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive device Simple and may lack features other similar devices have High maximum current May have poorer performance than other similar devices </li> <li> <p>IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2A 6VSON</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.03/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Smaller footprint Lower input voltage range High maximum current May be inconvient to solder </li> <li> <p>IC REG BUCK 3.3V 800MA 10VSSOP</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.25/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Higher efficiency More pins Adjustable output voltage More expensive than other options Low maximum current </li> </ol> <p>Selection and Rationale: I selected option #1 \"IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2A TSOT23-6\", it is the most simple, inexpensive and straightforward of the three options. The 2A limit is likely more than enough for my board, and the large input voltage range is plenty for the input power.

Mainly I just wanted the diffisued LEDs for the astetic, and i like the color red. On the more practical side, the LED used doesn't matter too much, and these LEDs will work just fine, the additional requirment of a resistor isn't too much added difficulty, and although the LED is small I believe I will be able to solder it.</p>"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#microcontroller-selection","title":"Microcontroller Selection","text":"ESP Info Answer Help Model ESP32-S3 Include the entire part number (leave off any letters at the end that specify the package type) Product Page URL link Found on Espressif.com ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 Datasheet URL link Do not paste links directly into the table.

It will also need 2 GPIO pins. This comes to a total of 10 pins, 2 i2C pins, 3 SPI pins, 1 clock pin, 1 power pin, 1 ground pin, and 2 GPIO pins.</p> <p>Description of role: The board I am tasked with creating will have abilitiy to take pictures with a camera, and then store that data, either on the ESP32 or an external microSD card. Storing data to the microSD card is a stretch goal, along with the possibility of storing video data.</p> <p>Pinout Diagram: </p> <p>Pin assignments:</p> <p>|Peripheral|Pins| |LED1|GPIO4, GND| |LED2|GPIO5, GND| |Camera|IO10-IO14, IO21, GND| |MicroSD|IO10-IO13, GND| |UART|IO36,IO37|</p> <p>Microcontroller selection: I have selected the ESP32 mainly because it is faster, and has more memory than the PIC. Saving image data will likely take a large chunk of the microcontrollers memory, and reading and moving that data will be helped by the ESP32's increased speed. Although the two options would likely both work, the increased storage size itself is enough of a reason to choose the ESP32.</p>"},{"location":"04-BOM/BOM/","title":"Module Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Written context needs to added!</p> <p>Pick ONLY one of the two examples show below.
