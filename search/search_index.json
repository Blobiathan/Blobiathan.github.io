Given that our team selected the Hub and Spoke setup, this device will function more as a subsystem. Using a thermalresistor to measure water temperature, and a IR sensor to detect user movement, my Curiosity Nano will read this information, and then send it to the Hub board via the 8 pin connector.</p> <p>Each of our boards have the first pin on the connected setup as an input, to recive measurement requests from the Hub board, and my system also outputs a digital and analog signal. The digital signal is detemined by whether or not there was significant movemnet, and the analog signal sends temperature data back to the Hub board. This board will also have two LED lights, a green light to indicate that it is functioning properly, and a blue light to indicate measurements being sent back to the Hub board.</p> <p>Since there are no actuators or higher voltage components connected to this board, it can run entirely off of the 5V 1.5A regulated power supply.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>5V Linear Regulator</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. L7805CV Linear Voltage Regulator IC$0.50/eachLink to product * Inexpensive* Straightforward to use* Already have one on hand, no delivery or purchace needed * Requires external components and support circuitry for interface * Option 2. * SparkFun Buck Regulator Breakout - 5V (AP63357) * $7.70/each * Link to product * No other components needed * more than double the required max current * On backorder * Will require a heatsink at higher currents * higher price than the other options * Option 3. * SparkFun BabyBuck Regulator Breakout - 5V (AP63357) * $5.95/each * Link to product * No other components needed * More than double the required maximum current * Very compact * Risk of overheating * Will require an effective heat sink <p>Choice: Option 1: L7805CV Linear Voltage Regulator IC</p> <p>Rationale: Option 2 and 3 are good choices, but their price does not justify their convenience. Option 1 is available, and simple enough to use, even if additional components are required for it to work. Additionally this PCB will not draw much current so the higher maximums of options 2 and 3 aren't much of a pro.</p> <p>Power Source</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. 9V wall power supply * Inexpensive* Straightforward to use* Already have one on hand, no delivery or purchace needed * Requires additional components to reduce voltage * Option 2. * Unregulated wall power supply *Large current and voltage * Requires rectification * PCB needs a transformer to reduce voltage * Option 3. * 9V Battery * Can be used outside of a home * Can be easily relocated * Need to replace batteries. * Requires additional components to reduce and regulate volatge <p>Choice: Option 1: 9V wall power supply</p> <p>Rationale: A wall adaptor was already provided to us. A battery wouldn't make sense for this device since it is stationary and located within a home. Additionally it would be diffucult and needlessly complex to rectify and regulate an unregulated wall power supply on the PCB itself so Option 1 is the ideal choice.</p> <p>Light Detector</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. PDV-P8103 Photo-Resistor$0.70/eachLink to product * Inexpensive* Already have one on hand, no delivery or purchace needed * Requires external components and support circuitry for interface * May not be very accurate * Option 2. * SparkFun Spectral UV Sensor - AS7331 * $27.50/each * Link to product * No other components needed * Low current draw  * Very accurate * Very expensive *  More complicatted connections * Lots of additional features that are not needed * Option 3. * SparkFun RGB Light Sensor - ISL29125 * $11.95/each * Link to product * No other components needed * Very low current draw* Quick communication with the microcontroller * Quite expensive * 3.3V logical voltage <p>Choice: Option 1: PDV-P8103 Photo-Resistor</p> <p>Rationale: The light detection I require does not need to be percise at all. I simply need any device to detect if there is or is not light. Option 2 and 3 are significantly more expensive than option 1, and much more complicated than they need to be. Option 1 is smaller, cheaper, and gets the job done.</p> <p>Moisture Sensor</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. HiLetgo 5pcs LM393 3.3V-5V Soil Moisture Detect Sensor$7.95/eachLink to product * Straightforward to use* screw terminals * Corrosion resistant * May require additional components* May not be very accurate * Option 2. * Adafruit Simple Soil Moisture Sensor * $3.00/each * Link to product * Small and compact * Low cost * May be too small for larger plants *  Not a very large range of output values * Option 3. * PIM520 * $4.6-/each * Link to product * No other components needed * Nice visual design* More accurate capacitive sensor* long probes for measuring deeper soil * More expensive * Extremely expensive shipping <p>Choice: Option 2: Adafruit Simple Soil Moisture Sensor</p> <p>Rationale: All options are very similar. Option 2 is much cheaper than 1 for essentially the same quality and function, so Option 1 is out. The capacitive sensor was interesting, but ultimatly nowhere near worth the higher cost and shipping time. Option 2 is also more compact, and our device is more geared towards smaller potted plants.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
